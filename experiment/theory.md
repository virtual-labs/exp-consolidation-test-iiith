When a compressive load is applied to soil mass, a decrease in its volume takes place, the decrease in volume of soil mass under stress is known as compression and the property of soil mass pertaining to its tendency to decrease in volume under pressure is known as compressibility. In a saturated soil mass having its void filled with incompressible water, decrease in volume or compression can take place when water is expelled out of the voids. Such a compression resulting from a long time static load and the consequent escape of pore water is termed as consolidation.

Then the load is applied on the saturated soil mass, the entire load is carried by pore water in the beginning. As the water starts escaping from the voids, the hydrostatic pressure in water gets gradually dissipated and the load is shifted to the soil solids which increases effective on them, as a result the soil mass decrease in volume. The rate of escape of water depends on the permeability of the soil.

Major problem in the soil is the soil subsidence caused by pressure or weight of construction trucks on the surface, which may be divided into three categories.
1. Elastic Deformation
2. Primary Consolidation
3. Secondary Consolidation

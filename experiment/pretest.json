			"question": "1. Porous stones are kept at the top and bottom of the specimen in consolidation test.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "True",
				"b": "False"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "In order to facilitate the drainage of pore water present between the soil particles, porous stones are kept at the top and the bottom of the soil specimen in consolidation test.",
				"b": "In order to facilitate the drainage of pore water present between the soil particles, porous stones are kept at the top and the bottom of the soil specimen in consolidation test."

			"question": "2. The vertical compression of the specimen is measured by means of ____.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "base plate",
				"b": "load frame",
				"c": "dial gauge",
				"d": "pressure ball"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "",
				"b": "",
				"c": "The vertical compression of the specimen is measured by means of a dial gauge. The dial gauge gives the readings of the deflection in the height of the soil specimen due to the applied loads.",
				"d": ""
			},
			"difficulty": "beginner",
			"correctAnswer": "c"
		},
		{
			"question": "3. In consolidation test, the soil is ____.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "restrained laterally",
				"b": "restrained vertically",
				"c": "not restrained laterally",
				"d": "not restrained laterally as well as vertically"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "In consolidation test, since the load on the soil specimen is applied in the vertical direction, the deflection due to the load is also in the vertical direction. Hence, in the consolidation test, the soil is restrained laterally.",
				"b": "",
				"c": "",
				"d": ""
